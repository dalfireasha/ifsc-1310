    <h2>Reflections On the Class and Final Project</h2>
    <p>I really enjoyed this class and project a lot more than I expected. Of course I had played around with HTML many years ago, 
    mainly on MySpace (I know – telling my age). It seemed so complex then. And I’m not saying it’s simple now, but now that I know 
    what I’m looking at and not just trying to alter some pre-coded HTML, it makes it much easier. It’s pretty cool to actually be 
    able to write up some HTML and then make the page look how I want. If I had to start over, I would probably put in a bit more 
    practice then I did, but I think I did fairly well while juggling full time school and a full time job.</p>
    <p>The final project has been lots of fun and frustration. You think you code something just right, but then instead of it showing 
    up in the location or format you want, it’s in a totally different spot. It has definitely been a learning experience figuring out 
    how to get things to work just right…though I’m still not there yet. The links with the custom bullets in my header really tested 
    me. I still didn’t get them exactly how I want – but it works.</p>

    <p>For my initial draft, I did a little CSS just to see how things were looking and if I liked my color scheme. I started off with 
    most everything being an article, which I liked, but most people said it made it look weird when the articles weren’t centered 
    in one area. But after doing the Cycle Lab, I figured that would be my fix. I like how it turned with that. I was also told that 
    perhaps I should do a custom background instead of just the blue. So I did that. I do like my custom background, but I think it 
    makes the white font a bit harder to read in some places, so I put a transparent background behind it. Everyone also thought it 
    would be best to put the “Measles” info on it’s own page, so I did that as well.</p>
    Overall, I like how it looks. I did like the articles as well, but I think the slides make it look a bit modern and the page less 
    busy.</p>
    
    <p>I really enjoyed this class and may look more into web development in the future. It’s amazing what you can do with websites 
        now a days. I definitely find it way more interesting than I expected.</p>
