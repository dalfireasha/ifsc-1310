    <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a way to make websites more accessible to everyone. Rather than only focusing on the presentation and 
    interactivity of the site, you start with the basics, the content and then build upon that with more and more things. This way, 
    those who may not have the most update browser or even care to use a different browser, or are unable to use JavaScript, or 
    whatever reason, can still enjoy the web without worrying about the page not working because they don’t have this app or this 
    plugin. You then build up to your presentation by adding your CSS and add your styling, and then the final flare of JavaScript 
    with more advanced features and interactions. It’s a bottom-up approach so that if things on the top don’t work, it can still go 
    down a layer and be a perfectly useable website.</p>
