  <h2>Battling Vaccine Misinformation</h2>
  <h3>What fuels vaccine hesitancy?</h3>
<p>Despite decades of scientific research and data, several persistent myths continue to lead people to delay or refuse vaccines. Let’s break them down with evidence.</p>
  
<section id="myths" class="container">
  <ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Myth 1: "Vaccines cause autism"</h4>
    <p>This claim began with a now-discredited 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, which has since been fully retracted due to ethical violations and falsified data. Dozens of high-quality studies have since found no link between vaccines and autism.</p>

        </ul>

      <h4>Myth 2: "Natural immunity is better than vaccine immunity"</h4>
      <p>While natural infection can lead to immunity, it comes with serious risks. For example, natural measles infection can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death. Vaccines offer a safe way to gain protection without the potentially severe consequences of the disease.</p>

      <h4>Myth 3: "Vaccines contain harmful toxins"</h4>
      <p>Some people worry about ingredients like aluminum, formaldehyde, or preservatives in vaccines.           But these substances are present in extremely small, safe amounts — often much lower than what            we’re naturally exposed to in food, air, and water. These ingredients are used to stabilize,            preserve, or enhance the effectiveness of vaccines, and they’ve been thoroughly tested for              safety. There’s more formaldehyde in a pear than in a vaccine dose.</p>
