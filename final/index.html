  <h2>Vaccines</h2>
<p>Vaccines are one of the greatest achievements in public health. They protect us, our families, and our communities from dangerous diseases—many of which were once widespread and deadly. Thanks to vaccination, illnesses like measles, polio, and whooping cough have been drastically reduced or even eliminated in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>But in recent years, declining vaccination rates and misinformation have led to a dangerous resurgence of preventable diseases. In 2025, the U.S. is facing its largest measles outbreak in years, highlighting how quickly these illnesses can return when vaccination coverage drops.</p>
