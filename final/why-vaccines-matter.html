   <h2>Why Vaccines Matter</h2>
   <p>Vaccines teach your immune system how to recognize and fight off harmful viruses or bacteria. 
    By introducing a harmless version of the germ—or part of it—your body learns to defend itself without the risk of serious illness. 
    This training means you can stop a disease before it ever takes hold.</p>

   <h3>Benefits of vaccines:</h3>
   <ol>
     <li><h4>They protect you</h4></li>
        <blockquote>Diseases like measles, polio, tetanus, and whooping cough can lead to hospitalization, long-term health problems, or even death. Vaccines significantly reduce your risk of contracting these illnesses—and if you do get sick, symptoms are often milder.</blockquote>

<li><h4>They protect others</h4></li>
    <blockquote>Not everyone can be vaccinated. People with weakened immune systems, allergies to vaccine ingredients, or infants too young to be vaccinated rely on you to keep disease from spreading. When enough people are vaccinated, it creates herd immunity, shielding the vulnerable from infection.</blockquote>

  <li><h4>They help eradicate disease globally</h4></li>
      <blockquote>Vaccination campaigns have led to the eradication of smallpox and brought polio to the brink of extinction. Diseases that were once common in the U.S.—like diphtheria and rubella—are now extremely rare, thanks to widespread vaccination.</blockquote>

  <li><h4>They save money and resources</h4></li>
      <blockquote>Preventing disease is far less expensive than treating it. Vaccines reduce hospital visits, missed school or work, and long-term care costs. According to the CDC, vaccines given to children in the U.S. between 1994 and 2018 will prevent an estimated 419 million illnesses and save $1.9 trillion in total societal costs.</blockquote>

<li><h4>They strengthen healthcare systems</h4></li>
    <blockquote>When fewer people get sick, hospitals and clinics can focus resources on emergencies and chronic conditions. Vaccines also reduce the need for antibiotics, helping to fight against antibiotic resistance.</blockquote>

  <h3>A Timely Reminder: Measles in 2025</h3>
<p>In 2025, the U.S. is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in over two decades, with more than 700 confirmed cases reported across multiple states, including significant clusters in Texas, New York, and California. The majority of these cases are occurring in unvaccinated children and adults, many of whom live in communities with low immunization rates.</p>

<p>Tragically, the outbreak has also led to seven confirmed deaths so far—most among young children and immunocompromised individuals who were unable to receive the vaccine themselves. These deaths are a stark reminder that measles is not a harmless childhood illness—it’s a highly contagious virus that can cause serious complications, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pneumonia</li>
  <li>Brain swelling (encephalitis)</li>
  <li>Blindness</li>
  <li>Long-term neurological damage</li>
  <li>Death</li>
  </ul>

<p>Before the measles vaccine became widely available in the 1960s, 400 to 500 people died every year in the U.S. alone due to measles. Thanks to vaccination, those numbers dropped dramatically—but as coverage slips, we risk returning to those dangerous times.</p>

  <p>The 2025 outbreak shows how quickly preventable diseases can resurface when public trust in vaccines declines. It’s not just about individual choice—it’s about protecting the most vulnerable among us and keeping our communities safe.</p>
