      <h2>A Timely Reminder: Measles in 2025</h2>
      <div class="Measles">
      <p>In 2025, the U.S. is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in over two decades, with more than 700 confirmed cases reported across multiple states, including significant clusters in Texas, New York, and California. The majority of these cases are occurring in unvaccinated children and adults, many of whom live in communities with low immunization rates.
        <br>
        <br>Tragically, the outbreak has also led to seven confirmed deaths so far—most among young children and immunocompromised individuals who were unable to receive the vaccine themselves. These deaths are a stark reminder that measles is not a harmless childhood illness—it’s a highly contagious virus that can cause serious complications, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pneumonia</li>
        <li>Brain swelling (encephalitis)</li>
        <li>Blindness</li>
        <li>Long-term neurological damage</li>
        <li>Death</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Before the measles vaccine became widely available in the 1960s, 400 to 500 people died every year in the U.S. alone due to measles. Thanks to vaccination, those numbers dropped dramatically—but as coverage slips, we risk returning to those dangerous times.
        <br>
        <br>The 2025 outbreak shows how quickly preventable diseases can resurface when public trust in vaccines declines. It’s not just about individual choice—it’s about protecting the most vulnerable among us and keeping our communities safe.</p>
