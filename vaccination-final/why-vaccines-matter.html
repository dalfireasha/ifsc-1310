  <h2>Why Vaccines Matter</h2>
  <p>Vaccines teach your immune system how to recognize and fight off harmful viruses or bacteria. 
    By introducing a harmless version of the germ—or part of it—your body learns to defend itself without the risk of serious illness. 
    This training means you can stop a disease before it ever takes hold.</p>

          <h3>Vaccines Protect You</h3>
          <p>Diseases like measles, polio, tetanus, and whooping cough can lead to hospitalization, long-term health problems, or even death. Vaccines significantly reduce your risk of contracting these illnesses—and if you do get sick, symptoms are often milder.</p>

            <h3>Vaccines Protect Others</h3>
          <p>Not everyone can be vaccinated. People with weakened immune systems, allergies to vaccine ingredients, or infants too young to be vaccinated rely on you to keep disease from spreading. When enough people are vaccinated, it creates herd immunity, shielding the vulnerable from infection.</p>

            <h3>Vaccines Help Eradicate Disease Globally</h3>
          <p>Vaccination campaigns have led to the eradication of smallpox and brought polio to the brink of extinction. Diseases that were once common in the U.S.—like diphtheria and rubella—are now extremely rare, thanks to widespread vaccination.</p>

            <h3>Vaccines Save Money and Resources</h3>
          <p>Preventing disease is far less expensive than treating it. Vaccines reduce hospital visits, missed school or work, and long-term care costs. According to the CDC, vaccines given to children in the U.S. between 1994 and 2018 will prevent an estimated 419 million illnesses and save $1.9 trillion in total societal costs.</p>

            <h3>Vaccines Strengthen Healthcare Systems</h3>
          <p>When fewer people get sick, hospitals and clinics can focus resources on emergencies and chronic conditions. Vaccines also reduce the need for antibiotics, helping to fight against antibiotic resistance.</p>
